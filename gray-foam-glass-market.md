<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gray Foam Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Cell</li><li>Open Cell</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gray foam glass is a versatile insulation material that comes in two main types: closed cell and open cell. Closed cell foam glass has closed pores that do not allow air or moisture to pass through, making it more rigid and suitable for areas requiring high compressive strength. Open cell foam glass, on the other hand, has open pores that allow air and moisture to flow through, providing better sound insulation and flexibility. Both types have their own specific uses in construction and insulation applications.</p></p>
