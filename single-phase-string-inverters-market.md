<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Phase String Inverters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Grid System Type</li><li>Off-Grid System Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single phase string inverters are widely used in both on-grid and off-grid solar power systems. On-grid system types are connected to the main grid and feed excess energy back into the grid, allowing for net metering and potentially reducing electricity bills. Off-grid system types, on the other hand, are not connected to the main grid and store excess energy in batteries for use during periods of low sunlight. Both types play a crucial role in increasing the adoption of solar energy systems worldwide.</p></p>
