<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Age-related Macular Degeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet AMD</li><li>Dry AMD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects primarily older adults. There are two main types of AMD: Wet AMD and Dry AMD. Wet AMD involves abnormal blood vessels growing under the macula, leading to rapid and severe vision loss. Treatment options for Wet AMD include injections and laser therapy. Dry AMD, on the other hand, progresses more slowly and is characterized by the gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells in the macula. There are currently no approved treatments for Dry AMD, but certain lifestyle changes may help slow its progression.</p></p>
