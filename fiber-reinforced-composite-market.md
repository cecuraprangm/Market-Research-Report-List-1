<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Reinforced Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Composites</li><li>Thermosetting Composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber reinforced composite materials are classified into two main types: Thermoplastic Composites and Thermosetting Composites. Thermoplastic composites are materials that can be reheated and reshaped multiple times without degrading, making them versatile and recyclable. On the other hand, thermosetting composites undergo irreversible chemical reactions when heated, resulting in a rigid and durable structure. Both types of composites offer unique benefits and are widely used in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and construction for their lightweight, high strength, and corrosion-resistant properties.</p></p>
