<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PU Slurry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Method</li><li>Wet Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PU slurry is a type of material used for various applications such as flooring, coatings, and sealants. It can be produced using two different methods: dry method and wet method. The dry method involves mixing powdered components of the slurry, such as polyols and isocyanates, to form a dry mix that can be stored and later mixed with a liquid to form a slurry. On the other hand, the wet method involves mixing liquid components directly to form a slurry. Both methods have unique advantages and are used based on specific requirements and industry preferences.</p></p>
