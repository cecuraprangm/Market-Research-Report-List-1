<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiberglass Rigid Board Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-Rigid Boards</li><li>Rigid Boards</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiberglass rigid board insulation is available in two main types: semi-rigid boards and rigid boards. Semi-rigid boards are more flexible and can be easily cut and installed in irregular spaces, making them a versatile option for various applications. Rigid boards, on the other hand, are stiffer and provide higher thermal resistance, making them ideal for applications that require maximum insulation. Both types of insulation boards are commonly used in residential and commercial construction to improve energy efficiency and reduce heating and cooling costs.</p></p>
