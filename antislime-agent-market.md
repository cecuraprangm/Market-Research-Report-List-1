<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antislime Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Oxidising Type</li><li>Oxidising Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antislime agents are used in various industries to prevent the growth of slime-forming organisms. Non-oxidising type antislime agents work by disrupting the cell membrane of slime-forming organisms without the use of oxidising agents, making them suitable for use in sensitive environments. On the other hand, oxidising type antislime agents work by releasing active oxygen species to oxidise and kill slime-forming organisms. Both types of antislime agents are effective in controlling slime growth, but their usage depends on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
