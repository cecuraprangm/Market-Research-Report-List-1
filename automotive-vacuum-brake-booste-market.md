<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Vacuum Brake Booste Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Diaphragm</li><li>Double Diaphragm</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive vacuum brake booster market can be classified into two main types: single diaphragm and double diaphragm. Single diaphragm boosters consist of a single flexible diaphragm that is moved by engine vacuum to increase braking force. On the other hand, double diaphragm boosters have two diaphragms that work together to amplify the force applied to the brake pedal. Both types are designed to improve braking performance and safety in vehicles by reducing the amount of force required to apply the brakes.</p></p>
