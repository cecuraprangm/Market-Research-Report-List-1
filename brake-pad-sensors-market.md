<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Brake Pad Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Electrical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The brake pad sensors market can be classified into two main types: mechanical and electrical. Mechanical brake pad sensors rely on physical contact or wear indicators to indicate when the brake pads need replacing. In contrast, electrical brake pad sensors are equipped with electronic components that send signals to the dashboard when the brake pads are worn out. Both types serve the same purpose of alerting drivers when their brake pads need attention, but they utilize different mechanisms to do so.</p></p>
