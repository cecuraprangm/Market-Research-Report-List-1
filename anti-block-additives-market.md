<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-block Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic</li><li>Organic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anti-block additives are used in polymer processing to prevent the surfaces of film layers from sticking together. Inorganic anti-block additives are typically mineral-based substances like silica, talc, or clay, which create a rough surface on the film to prevent blocking. Organic anti-block additives are usually made from synthetic materials like polymethyl methacrylate or nylon, which provide a more slippery surface to prevent sticking. Both types of additives serve the same purpose of improving film handling and preventing damage during storage and transportation.</p></p>
