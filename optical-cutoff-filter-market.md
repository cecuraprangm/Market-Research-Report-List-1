<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Cutoff Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shortpass Filter</li><li>Longpass Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical cutoff filters are used in various industries for light manipulation. Shortpass filters allow short wavelengths to pass through while blocking longer wavelengths, while Longpass filters do the opposite. Shortpass filters are commonly used in applications such as fluorescence microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, where blocking unwanted longer wavelengths is crucial. Longpass filters are utilized in scenarios where only longer wavelengths are needed, such as in astronomy and environmental monitoring. Both types of filters help improve the quality and accuracy of optical systems.</p></p>
