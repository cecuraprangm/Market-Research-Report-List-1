<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Plate Iron-Remover Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electromagnetic</li><li>Permanent Magnet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Plate iron-remover markets are categorized into two main types: electromagnetic and permanent magnet. Electromagnetic plate iron-removers use an electric current to create a magnetic field, which attracts and removes iron particles from materials passing through. Permanent magnet plate iron-removers, on the other hand, use a fixed magnetic field generated by permanent magnets to accomplish the same task. Both types of plate iron-removers are commonly used in industries such as mining, recycling, and construction to separate iron contaminants from bulk materials.</p></p>
