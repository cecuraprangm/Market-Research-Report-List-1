<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propene Polymer Decking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped composite</li><li>Uncapped composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propene polymer decking comes in two main types: capped composite and uncapped composite. Capped composite decking features a protective outer layer that adds durability and resistance to staining, fading, and scratching. This makes it a popular choice for high-traffic areas and outdoor spaces. Uncapped composite decking, on the other hand, does not have this protective layer, making it more affordable but potentially more susceptible to wear and tear over time. Both types offer a low-maintenance alternative to traditional wood decking.</p></p>
