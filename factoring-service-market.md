<p><ul><li>Recourse</li><li>Non-recourse</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Factoring services can be categorized into two main types - recourse and non-recourse markets. In a recourse market, the factor has the right to recourse to the seller if the debtor does not pay, meaning the seller remains liable for the debt. In a non-recourse market, the factor assumes the risk of non-payment by the debtor, providing more security to the seller. Recourse markets are more common and generally have lower fees, while non-recourse markets offer greater protection but come with higher costs.</p></p>
