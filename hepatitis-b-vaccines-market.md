<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hepatitis B Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Yeast Derived</li><li>CHO Derived</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hepatitis B vaccines are available in two main types: Yeast Derived and CHO Derived. Yeast Derived vaccines are produced by inserting the gene for the hepatitis B antigen into yeast cells, which then produce the antigen that stimulates the immune response against the virus. CHO Derived vaccines, on the other hand, are produced by using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that have been genetically modified to express the hepatitis B antigen. Both types are effective in preventing hepatitis B infection and are widely used in the market.</p></p>
