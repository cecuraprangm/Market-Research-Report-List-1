<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Noise Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier is a type of concrete noise barrier that is typically installed on the ground level along highways, railways, and industrial areas to reduce noise pollution. It is a cost-effective solution that effectively absorbs and reflects noise. </p><p>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier, on the other hand, is installed on existing structures such as walls, bridges, or buildings to block or reduce noise transmission. This type of barrier is ideal for urban areas where space is limited and can be customized to blend in with the surrounding architecture.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Concrete Noise Barrier Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ground-Mounted Noise Barrier</li><li>Structure-Mounted Noise Barrier</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concrete noise barriers are used in two main applications - ground-mounted and structure-mounted. Ground-mounted noise barriers are installed directly on the ground to block noise from highways, railways, and industrial areas. Structure-mounted noise barriers are attached to existing walls or structures to reduce noise pollution in urban environments. Both types of barriers are commonly used to mitigate noise levels and improve the quality of life for nearby residents and workers.</p></p>
